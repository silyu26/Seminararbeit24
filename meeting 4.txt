iS there any tr. process steps that are general 

which steps of the tr pro. can be generalized by comparing models
they may share some steps, but also have some differences, so llm
can deal with different things

Try to create a comparison table of the LLMs: nr. of parameters
specific use cases, think about the dimensions that need to be compared
since they are the general attributes that chara. a model

challenges and solutions don't need to be use case specific. define the general
challenges before presenting the use cases. It's too fast to directly come to 
the use cases, try to discuss it specific and precisely what challenges are there, 
then there should be the solutions and use cases targeting the challenges.
Then the rest may be the future topics.

In  this seminar, we'll answer the following questions:
bullet points.....(slides) 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

new contents to come: 

1. The table of comparisons
2. more of catastrophic forgetting, concept drift, maybe some examples?
3. more introduction to different LLMs, summarize the common & indifferent aspects
    - more or less unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning.
    -
4. More use cases?
